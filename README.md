Test

1.	Create 5 Gherkin scenarios for the following: “As a user I want to create a new account for mendeley.com”
2.	Automate one of the scenarios created above.
3.	Upload your codebase to github, make sure it's set to Public and provide us with the link.
N.B. - You can use any programming language you desire! We want to understand how you use automation with BDD.
We’re really looking forward to reviewing your responses!
